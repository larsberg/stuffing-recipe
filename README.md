INGERDIENTS:
------------

- [ ] 4 cups chopped onions (maybe less, depending on how potent the onion is)

- [ ] 2 cups chopped celery (I usually use less, but include the leaves if there are any)

- [ ] 3 garlic cloves, minced

- [ ] 2.25 sticks unsalted butter

- [ ] 0.5 lb mushrooms, sliced

- [ ] 1 lb chicken livers, trimmed and chopped (NEVER NEVER NEVER) but include them if you want

- [ ] 0.5 cup sherry (I use Madeira)

- [ ] 6 cups cooked rice

- [ ] 4 hard-cooked eggs ( I usually use at least six)

- [ ] 2 cups toasted pecans, chopped coarse, or more, if you like.  Leave some whole.

- [ ] 0.5 cups fresh parsley leaves, minced

- [ ] 2 TBSP dried sage or 4 TSBP fresh sage

- [ ] 2 tsp dried thyme, or 4 tsp fresh thyme

- [ ] 0.5 tsp ground mace (I don't think I have ever added this)

- [ ] 0.5 tsp freshly grated nutmeg



INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------

1. To make the stuffing:  In a large stainless steel or enameled skillet cook the onion, celery, and garlic with salt and pepper to taste in 2 sticks of unsalted butter over moderate heat, stirring until the vegetables are softened and transfer the mixture to a large bowl.

2. In the skillet saute the mushrooms with salt and pepper to taste in the remaining 2 TBSP of butter over moderately high heat, stirring for 2 or 3 minutes, or until they begin to give off their liquid.

3. Add the chicken livers and the turkey liver (ONLY IF YOU MUST) and cook the mixture, stirring 2 or 3 minutes, or until the livers are just slightly pink (UGH!!!!).Add the Sherry/Madeira and reduce the liquid, stirring occasionally, to about 1 TBSP.

4. Add the liver mixture to the vegetables, stir in the rice, the hard-cooked eggs, the pecans, the parsley, the sage, the thyme, the mace, the nutmeg, and salt and pepper to taste, and let the stuffing cool completely.

5. Stuff the turkey when you are ready.  This should be more than enough fora 15 lb turkey.
